        <h1>Hybrid Hamburger Stroganoff</h1>
        <img src="food.png">
        <h3>Description:-</h3>
        <p>I created this hamburger stroganoff as 
           an amalgamation of about a half-dozen stroganoff recipes.
           Really hits the spot on a cold day, served over egg noodles with peas and carrots.
        </p>
         <h4>Ingredidents:-</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
             <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
             <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Step:-</h4>
             <ol>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add beef, mushrooms, and onion. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly,
                5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer mixture to a bowl.
                Add garlic and oil to the skillet; saute until garlic is golden brown, about 1 minute.
             </ol>
             <ol>
                Turn skillet heat to high; add red wine and beef stock.
                Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
                Reduce heat and simmer until flavors meld, about 5 minutes.
            </ol>
